about= This tool can be used to import Geo-Tagged photos (jpg or jpeg) as points to QGIS. The user is able to select a folder with photos and only the geo-tagged photos will be taken. Then a geoJSON point file will be created which will contain the name of the picture, its directory, the date and time taken, altitude, longitude, latitude, azimuth, north and camera maker and model. The plug-in doesnâ€™t need any third party applications to work. It has two buttons; the one is to import geotagged photos, and the other one is to be able to click on a point and display the photo along with information regarding the date time and altitude. Mac users please refer to the Read Me file for further guidance.
